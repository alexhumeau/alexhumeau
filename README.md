# Hi, I'm Alex 👋

I'm a product leader with 10+ years building and scaling SaaS products, recently spending a lot of time exploring how AI can *actually* improve product discovery, delivery, and execution.
I come from a Head of Product / VP Product background, but I stay hands-on. 
I like understanding the tools, building prototypes myself, and stress-testing ideas before turning them into roadmaps, teams, or processes.

My current focus is at the intersection of **Product leadership**, **AI-assisted building**, and **pragmatic execution**.

## What I work on

• Exploring AI-powered coding tools and builders  
I actively experiment with tools like Claude Code, Lovable, Anti-Gravity, Cursor to understand where they shine, where they break, and how they can realistically fit into a product team’s workflow.

• Building small to mid-scope AI apps and prototypes  
From simple internal tools to more product-like apps, I build prototypes to learn fast. Examples include:
  – AI-assisted memoir and storytelling products  
  – Lightweight B2C apps using LLMs, RAG, and structured content  
  – Internal product tools to reduce manual PM work

• Optimizing product workflows with AI  
I explore how AI can automate or augment:
  – Product discovery and synthesis  
  – Spec writing and documentation  
  – Feedback analysis and prioritization  
  – Product Ops and cross-team alignment

The goal is not “AI everywhere”, but fewer slow, manual steps and better decision quality.

## About me

I’m a senior product leader with experience leading large product teams in B2B SaaS, shipping complex products used by thousands of customers.

I care deeply about:
• User experience and product quality  
• Clear product strategy grounded in reality  
• Strong product operations and scalable team structures  
• Hands-on problem solving, even at leadership level

Over the years, I’ve worked closely with engineering, design, data, and business teams to turn fuzzy problems into products that ship and evolve.

## Let’s talk

If you’re:
• Exploring AI workflows for your product or team  
• Looking to prototype AI-powered features quickly  
• Rethinking how your product organization operates  
• Needing help structuring or scaling a product team  

Feel free to reach out. I’m always interested in meaningful product and AI discussions.
